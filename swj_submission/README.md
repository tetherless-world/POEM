### Abstract
Psychometrics is the field relating to the measurement of concepts within psychology, particularly the assessment of
various social and psychological dimensions in humans. The relationship between entities such as an assessment instrument and its component elements, the subject and respondent, and the latent variables being assessed, is critical to finding an appropriate assessment instrument, especially in the context of clinical psychology and mental healthcare in which providing the best care based on empirical evidence is crucial. The current standard for questionnaire-based assessment relies on text-based distributions of instruments; so, a structured representation is necessary to capture these relationships to enhance accessibility and use of existing measures, encourage reuse of questionnaires and their component elements, and enable sophisticated reasoning over assessment instruments and results by increasing interoperability. We present the design process and architecture of such a domain ontology, the Psychometric Ontology of Experiences and Measures, situating it within the context of related ontologies, and demonstrating its practical utility through evaluation against a series of competency questions concerning the creation, use, and reuse of psychometric questionnaires in clinical, research, and development settings.

## [POEM.rdf](POEM.rdf)
This file contains the POEM ontology. It imports the Semanticscience Integrated Ontology (SIO) in its entirety, but future plans are underway to apply MIREOT principles and import only necessary classes and axioms from SIO.

## Individual files
The files provided include an example of POEM's usage on currently available data about the [Revised Child Anxietry and Depression Scale (RCADS)](https://rcads.ucla.edu/), [My Thoughts about Therapy (MTT)](https://www.childfirst.ucla.edu/resources/), and the [nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9)](https://www.apa.org/depression-guideline/patient-health-questionnaire.pdf). The individual files are divided as described below for ease of compilation and browsing. The included data is not intended to reflect the complete or final state of the RCADS, MTT, or PHQ-9, and is only intended to show how existing questionnaires might align with POEM. Additionally, our current modeling is subject to change.
