### Competency Questions

The following document outlines questions that the usage of POEM should enable the answering of in various contexts, particularly clinical assessment, clinical monitoring, questionnaire production and synthesis in research settings, and translation. It also provides some example answers based on the [Revised Child Anxiety and Depression Scale (RCADS)](https://rcads.ucla.edu/).
