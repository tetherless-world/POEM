### Ontology Use Cases

Below are example ontology use cases — expand any item to view a short description of how the ontology supports that scenario.

<details>
        <summary><strong>UC01: Clinical Service: Assessment</strong></summary>
        <p>Finding the most appropriate assessment for a specific patient and context based on conditions measured, available languages and norms, provenance, and metrics showing primary utility and exposing strength of evidence; elucidating instrument usage instructions, target subject and respondent, and what an instrument measures.</p>
</details>

<details>
        <summary><strong>UC02: Clinical Service: Monitoring</strong></summary>
        <p>Finding the most appropriate assessment for a specific patient and context, which may include reuse of initial questionnaires and scales, or establishing confidence in a shorter assessment for ease of repeated use; elucidating instrument usage instructions, target subject and respondent, and what an instrument measures.</p>
</details>

<details>
        <summary><strong>UC03: Research: Production</strong></summary>
        <p>Determining whether appropriate measures already exist, identifying where reliability and validity may be improved by iterating on an assessment or creating a new one, and supporting the semantic representation of new measures.</p>
</details>

<details>
        <summary><strong>UC04: Research: Synthesis</strong></summary>
        <p>Supporting the process of combining the results of multiple studies by providing standardized representation of both external and internal questionnaire structure, metadata, and variables.</p>
</details>

<details>
        <summary><strong>UC05: Developer: Translation</strong></summary>
        <p>Determining whether specific language translations of questionnaires exist, as well as their reliability and validity (which may be very different from the original language iteration), determining the minimum design elements needed to create a valid derivative measure, and directing developers towards the provenance and meanings of constructs measured, which should support the accurate translation or adaptation of questionnaires in both linguistic and cultural contexts.</p>
